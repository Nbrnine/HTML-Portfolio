<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I live in Illinois and have three amazing kiddos. My favorite thing is laughing, playing and exploring with my kids and learning all about the world through their eyes.  
  I barely remember life before my family as they light up my life so much, its hard to see anything else.  
  Once upon a time, I worked as a firefighter and then as a paramedic.  I loved both immensly and was fortunate enough to do this for 20 years.  
  It was a very fulfilling job and I can honestly say I loved my job!  
  Making a difference was what first drew me to that path and there are many ways to do that!
  Searching for a better work and life balance led me to be a web deleloper.  I love the creativity of developing and still being able to make a difference for others.  
  I hope to be able to freelance and donate some time to non profits, and causes near to my heart and use my skills to help them achieve their goals.
